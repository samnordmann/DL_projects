In this repo, I propose two jupyter notebooks :
- Transformers_Notes.ipynb : a detailed report on the original article introducing the Transformer architecture [Vaswani et. al., Attention is all you need. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017]
- a Tensorflow implementation from scratch of the Transformer architecture (Transformer_implementation.ipynb).
